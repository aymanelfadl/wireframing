# Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a fundamental technique in the design process that helps visualize the layout and functionality of a website or application. It acts as a blueprint or skeleton, providing a simple representation of the user interface without detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

## Key Elements in a Wireframe

### Layout Structure
The layout structure defines how elements are arranged on the page. It sets the foundation for the user interface and ensures the design follows a logical flow. 
- **Example**: In a booking system, placing the search bar at the top and the property list below ensures users can quickly find available properties.

### Navigation
Navigation refers to the way users move between different pages or sections of the app or website.
- **Example**: A simple navigation bar with links to "Home", "Search", "Bookings", and "Profile" helps users easily navigate the booking system.

### Content Placement
Content placement shows where various elements like text, images, and buttons will appear. It is important for ensuring the content is displayed in a clear, organized manner.
- **Example**: Placing booking details (property name, price, and dates) in a clearly defined section ensures users can quickly scan the relevant information.

### Functionality
Functionality represents the interactive elements of the wireframe, such as buttons, links, and forms. These elements are critical for user engagement and ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Example**: A "Book Now" button must be easily accessible and prominently placed to encourage users to complete the booking process.

# Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be classified into two types: **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**. Understanding the differences helps you choose the right one based on the stage of your project.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough sketches or basic outlines. They focus on layout and functionality without details such as colors, images, or typography. These are typically used in the early stages of the design process to quickly visualize concepts and gather feedback.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and closer to the final product design. They often include exact measurements, fonts, and interactions. These are used later in the design process to fine-tune the design before development begins.

## What Type of Wireframe is Here?

The wireframe used in this project is a **high-fidelity wireframe**, which includes detailed design elements like typography, interactions, and layout, closely resembling the final product.
