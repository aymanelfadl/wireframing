# Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a fundamental technique in the design process that helps visualize the layout and functionality of a website or application. It acts as a blueprint or skeleton, providing a simple representation of the user interface without detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

## Key Elements in a Wireframe

### Layout Structure
The layout structure defines how elements are arranged on the page. It sets the foundation for the user interface and ensures the design follows a logical flow. 
- **Example**: In a booking system, placing the search bar at the top and the property list below ensures users can quickly find available properties.

### Navigation
Navigation refers to the way users move between different pages or sections of the app or website.
- **Example**: A simple navigation bar with links to "Home", "Search", "Bookings", and "Profile" helps users easily navigate the booking system.

### Content Placement
Content placement shows where various elements like text, images, and buttons will appear. It is important for ensuring the content is displayed in a clear, organized manner.
- **Example**: Placing booking details (property name, price, and dates) in a clearly defined section ensures users can quickly scan the relevant information.

### Functionality
Functionality represents the interactive elements of the wireframe, such as buttons, links, and forms. These elements are critical for user engagement and ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Example**: A "Book Now" button must be easily accessible and prominently placed to encourage users to complete the booking process.
